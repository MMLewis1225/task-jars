# task-jars

TaskJars is a mobile task management application designed to assist users who struggle with traditional to-do lists due to indecision, lack of motivation, and lack of focus. The app categorizes tasks into three “jars” (Minutes, Hours, and Days) based on estimated completion times, requires users to focus on completing one task at a time, and allows users to set daily goals and track their progress with a “streak” system to boost motivation.

TaskJars was a semester-long group project for CS 4720 (Mobile Application Development).
